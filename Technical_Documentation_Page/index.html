                    React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Learn what React is all about on our
                    homepage or in the tutorial.

                <h3>Try React</h3>
                <p>
                    React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much
                    React
                    as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page,
                    or
                    start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.

            <article>
                <p>
                    The smallest React example looks like this:
                </p>
                <img src="images/hello_world.png" alt="">

                <p>
                    It displays a heading saying “Hello, world!” on the page.

                <h1>How to Read This Guide</h1>
                <p>In this guide, we will examine the building blocks of React apps: elements and components. Once you
                    master them, you can create complex apps from small reusable pieces.</p>

                <h4>Tip</h4>
                <p><code>This guide is designed for people who prefer learning concepts step by step. If you prefer
                        to
                        learn by doing, check out our practical tutorial. You might find this guide and the tutorial
                        complementary to each other.</code></p>

                        This is the first chapter in a step-by-step guide about main React concepts. You can find a list
                        of all its chapters in the navigation sidebar. If you’re reading this from a mobile device, you
                        can access the navigation by pressing the button in the bottom right corner of your screen.

                            learn most of React by reading the “Main Concepts” guide chapters in the order they appear
                            in
                            the sidebar.</b> For example, “Introducing JSX” is the next chapter after this one.

                    <li>
                        This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React
                        to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it
                        comes with the full power of JavaScript.</li>
                    <li>
                        JSX produces React “elements”. We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the next section.
                        Below, you can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started.

                    Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.
                </p>

                <p>
                    An element describes what you want to see on the screen:
                </p>
                <img src="images/2.png" alt="">
                <p>
                    Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM
                    takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.
                </p>
                <h4>Note:</h4>
                <p><code> One might confuse elements with a more widely known concept of “components”. We will
                        introduce
                        components in the next section. Elements are what components are “made of”, and we encourage you
                        to read this section before jumping ahead.</code></p>

                Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in
                isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components. You can find a detailed
                component API reference here.
                <code>Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called
                    “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

            <article>
                <p>The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:</p>
                <img src="images/3.png" alt="">
                <p>This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for
                    properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “function
                    components” because they are literally JavaScript functions.</p>

                Consider the ticking clock example from one of the previous sections. In Rendering Elements, we have
                only learned one way to update the UI. We call ReactDOM.render() to change the rendered output:

            <p>
                In this section, we will learn how to make the Clock component truly reusable and encapsulated. It will
                set up its own timer and update itself every second.

        <section class="main-section" id="Handling_Events">
            <header>Handling Events</header>
            <article>
                Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some
                syntax differences:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For example, the HTML:
                </p>
                <img src="images/5.png" alt="">
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Conditional_Rendering">
            <header>Conditional Rendering</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can
                    render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript
                    operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and
                    let React update the UI to match them.
                </p>
                <p>Consider these two components:</p>
                <img src="images/6.png" alt="">
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Lists_and_Keys">
            <header>Lists and Keys</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    <code>First, let’s review how you transform lists in JavaScript.</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given the code below, we use the map() function to take an array of numbers and double their values.
                    We assign the new array returned by map() to the variable doubled and log it:
                </p>
                <img src="images/7.png" alt="">
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Forms">
            <header>Forms</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements
                    naturally keep some internal state. For example, this form in plain HTML accepts a single name:
                </p>
                <img src="images/8.png" alt="">
                <p>
                    This form has the default HTML form behavior of browsing to a new page when the user submits the
                    form. If you want this behavior in React, it just works. But in most cases, it’s convenient to have
                    a JavaScript function that handles the submission of the form and has access to the data that the
                    user entered into the form. The standard way to achieve this is with a technique called “controlled
                    components”.

            <header>Lifting State Up</header>
            <article>
                <p>Often, several components need to reflect the same changing data. We recommend lifting the shared
                    state up to their closest common ancestor. Let’s see how this works in action.
                </p>
                <p>In this section, we will create a temperature calculator that calculates whether the water would boil
                    at a given temperature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will start with a component called BoilingVerdict. It accepts the celsius temperature as a prop,
                    and prints whether it is enough to boil the water:

            <article>
                <p>React has a powerful composition model, and we recommend using composition instead of inheritance to
                    reuse code between components.</p>
                <p>In this section, we will consider a few problems where developers new to React often reach for
                    inheritance, and show how we can solve them with composition.</p>

                        like Sidebar or Dialog that represent generic “boxes”.
                    </p>
                    <p>We recommend that such components use the special children prop to pass children elements
                        directly into their output:

                <p>One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them. In this

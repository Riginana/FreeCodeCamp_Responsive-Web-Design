            <p> 1. “I won’t be a rock star. I will be a legend.” </p>
            <p>2. “You can be anything you want to be, just turn yourself into anything you think that you could ever
                be.”</p>
            <p>3. “The most important thing is to live a fabulous life. As long as it’s fabulous I don’t care how long
                it is.”</p>
            <p>4. “I always knew I was a star. And now, the rest of the world seems to agree with me.”</p>
            <p>5. “I’m possessed by love, but isn’t everybody?”</p>
            <p>6. “I like to be surrounded by splendid things.”</p>
            <p>7. “Dullness is a disease.”</p>
            <p>8. “What will I be doing in 20 years time? I’ll be dead, darling! Are you crazy?”</p>
            <p>9. “Who wants to live forever?”</p>
            <p>10. “I’m just a musical prostitute, my dear.”</p>
            <p>11. “I think my melodies are superior to my lyrics.”</p>
            <p>12. “I’m very emotional. I think I may go mad in several years time.”</p>
            <p>13. “When I’m dead, I want to be remembered as a musician of some worth and substance.”</p>
            <p>14. “The reason we’re successful, darling? My overall charisma, of course.”</p>
            <p>15. “If I die tomorrow I will not regret. I really did everything I could.”</p>
            <p>16. “The whole point of Queen was to be original.”</p>
            <p>17. “When we began, we approached it the way we did because we were not prepared to be out-of-work
                musicians,
                ever. We said either take it on as a serious commodity or don’t do it at all.”</p>
            <p>18. “A lot of my songs are fantasy. I can dream up all kinds of things. That’s the kind of world I live
                in.
                It’s very sort of flamboyant, and that’s the kind of way I write. I love it.”</p>
            <p>19. “The concept of Queen is to be regal and majestic. Glamour is part of us, and we want to be dandy.”
            </p>
            <p>20. “A concert is not a live rendition of our album. It’s a theatrical event.”</p>
            <p> 21. “I love the fact that I can make people happy, in any form. Even if it’s just an hour of their
                lives, if
                I can make them feel lucky or make them feel good, or bring a smile to a sour face, that to me is
                worthwhile.”</p>
            <p>22. “Years ago, I thought up the name Queen. It’s just a name. But it’s regal, obviously, and sounds
                splendid.”</p>
            <p>23. “Money can not buy happiness, but it can damn well give it!”</p>
            <p>24. “Oh, I was not made for heaven. No, I don’t want to go to heaven. Hell is much better. Think of all
                the
                interesting people you’re going to meet down there”</p>
            <p>25. “My soul has painted like the wings of butterflies, Fairy tales of yesterday will grow but never die,
                I can fly, my friends…”</p>
